I had a whole blog post written about how Keenan had us tricked, and how we needed to overload the operator= for the Proxy example but that wasn't in the lecture.  It's in the book, and I thought this was a clever way to get us to do the reading.

Then I realized I had a bug in my implementation and the operator= was not necessary.  So never mind.
