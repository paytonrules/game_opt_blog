Just got the SIMD optimizations done, unfortunately, I don't seem to see 'optimization' for one of them.  The Vector * Matrix multiplication came out this way:

<pre>
--------- Vect4D ----------------
  Vect4D Orig: 0.176137  
  Vect4D_SIMD: 0.040577
       Faster: 4.340783


---------- Matrix ----------------
  Matrix Orig: 1.105464
  Matrix SIMD: 0.765734
       Faster: 1.443666


---------- Vect * Matrix ----------------
  Vect*Matrix Orig: 0.740983
  Vect*Matrix_SIMD: 1.517424
            Faster: 0.488316
</pre>

The part that has me puzzled?  To do the Vect * Matrix I do a transpose on the matrix and then dot products, using my optimized code.  Those optimizations are in the Vect4D and Matrix code which is faster.  Spooooky.

Still a week behind, and tomorrow I won't be at class because I have a 1 year old and 3 year old, and you don't miss Halloween when they are that age.
